# Overview
This project aims to create a standalone Python script that interacts with Gmail using the OAuth-authenticated Gmail API. It will fetch emails, store them in a database, and apply user-defined rules to perform actions on these emails.

# Requirements

## System Requirements
- Python environment with necessary libraries:
  - google-api-python-client
  - google-auth-httplib2
  - google-auth-oauthlib
- Database library (e.g., psycopg2 for PostgreSQL, mysql-connector-python for MySQL, sqlite3 for SQLite)
- JSON library (built-in json module)
- A Gmail account with API access enabled
- A database server (optional, if using PostgreSQL or MySQL)

## Script Functionality
- **Authentication**:
  - Authenticate to Gmail API using OAuth.
- **Email Fetching**:
  - Retrieve emails from the user's Gmail Inbox using the Gmail API.
- **Database Storage**:
  - Create a database table to store fetched email data (sender, recipient, subject, body, received time, etc.).
  - Populate the table with fetched emails.
- **Rule Definition**:
  - Define rules in a JSON file with the following structure:
    - `rules`: A list of rules.
    - Each rule has:
      - `conditions`: A list of conditions.
      - `predicate`: Either "ALL" or "ANY" (determining how conditions are combined).
      - `actions`: A list of actions to be performed if the rule matches.
  - Supported fields for conditions: `From`, `To`, `Subject`, `Message`, `ReceivedDate`.
  - Supported predicates: `contains`, `not_contains`, `equals`, `not_equals`, `less_than`, `greater_than`.
  - Supported actions: `mark_as_read`, `mark_as_unread`, `move_message`.
- **Rule Evaluation**:
  - Process emails from the database.
  - Evaluate each rule against the email based on its conditions and predicate.
  - Execute actions for matching rules.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Implement appropriate error handling for API calls, database operations, and rule processing.

## Additional Considerations
- **Performance**:
  - Optimize email fetching and processing for efficiency.
  - Consider batching operations for better performance.
- **Scalability**:
  - Design the system to handle a large number of emails and rules.
- **Security**:
  - Protect sensitive information (OAuth credentials, email content) appropriately.
  
By following these requirements, the script will effectively manage emails based on user-defined rules.
